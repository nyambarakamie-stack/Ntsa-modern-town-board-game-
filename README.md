# Driving school MTB GAME

A modern, interactive "Motor Town Board" driving school trainer focused on MTB (Motor Traffic Board) scenarios.
This project is a browser-based training game intended to teach road rules, parking, roundabouts and vehicle handling for motorcycles, cars, buses and trailers.

Features
- Drag-and-drop vehicle placement on a town board background
- Multiple vehicle sizes & level-based challenges
- Snap-to-position targets and scoring system
- Works inside Telegram Web Apps (defensive handling) and in a normal browser
- Responsive canvas with high-DPI support

Getting started
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/nyambarakamie/driving-school-mtb-game.git
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (or host with a static server).
3. Optional: run inside a Telegram Web App for enhanced integration.

File layout (suggested)
- index.html         — main game UI and logic
- assets/            — images, sprites, audio
- docs/              — design docs, level definitions
- README.md
- LICENSE

Possible next steps
- Add local assets in `assets/` for reliability and privacy
- Move configuration (levels, snap positions) to JSON files
- Improve visuals and accessibility, add sound and animations
- Add CI to validate builds and run basic tests
- Publish a GitHub Pages demo
