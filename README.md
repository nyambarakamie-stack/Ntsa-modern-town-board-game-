## Sample NTSA Scenarios

Experience these interactive MTB scenarios in neon-glowing cyber streets:

1. **Roundabout Entry Challenge**: In a bustling cyber roundabout where holographic vehicles converge, prioritize incoming traffic from the right. Select your lane and enter without collision – no stopping, hooting, or overtaking allowed!

2. **Zebra Crossing Dilemma**: Approach an uncontrolled neon-striped zebra crossing (no lights, no police). Yield to holographic pedestrians; fail to stop, and trigger a game-over alert.

3. **Overtaking Protocol**: On a dual carriageway with glowing yellow lines, decide when to overtake: avoid junctions, no-overtaking signs, and roundabouts. Use forward gear for precision maneuvers.

4. **Traffic Light Test**: At a futuristic intersection, green means go – unless halted by a virtual police bot. Respond to changing neon signals in real-time for bonus points.

5. **Parking Puzzle**: Navigate angle parking in a neon-lit lot: park from the furthest end using forward gear, exit in reverse. Only saloon hover-cars allowed – master it to level up!
